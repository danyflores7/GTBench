GPT OSS 20B Overview
Description:
OpenAI releases the gpt-oss family of open-weight models designed for powerful reasoning, agentic tasks, and versatile developer use cases. The family consists of the:

gpt-oss-120b — for production, general purpose, high reasoning use-cases that fits into a single H100 GPU (117B parameters with 5.1B active parameters)
gpt-oss-20b — for lower latency, and local or specialized use-cases (21B parameters with 3.6B active parameters).
The gpt-oss-20b is designed as a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model, structurally identical to the larger 117B variant, albeit with different hyperparameters. This model leverages SwiGLU activations and incorporates learned attention sinks within its architecture. Functionally, it serves as a robust reasoning model, supporting advanced capabilities such as chain-of-thought processing, adjustable reasoning effort levels, instruction following, and tool use. It operates strictly with text-only modalities for both input and output. A key strategic benefit is its suitability for enterprises and governments, facilitating on-premises or private cloud deployment to ensure enhanced data security and privacy.

Model Highlights:

Permissive Apache 2.0 license: Build freely without copyleft restrictions or patent risk—ideal for experimentation, customization, and commercial deployment.
Configurable reasoning effort: Easily adjust the reasoning effort (low, medium, high) based on your specific use case and latency needs.
Full chain-of-thought: Gain complete access to the model's reasoning process, facilitating easier debugging and increased trust in outputs. It's not intended to be shown to end users.
Fine-tunable: Fully customize models to your specific use case through parameter fine-tuning.
Agentic capabilities: Use the models' native capabilities for function calling, web browsing, python code execution, and structured outputs.
This model is ready for commercial/non-commercial use.

Our AI models are designed and/or optimized to run on NVIDIA GPU-accelerated systems [or name equivalent hardware preference]. By leveraging NVIDIA’s hardware (e.g. GPU cores) and software frameworks (e.g., CUDA libraries), the model achieves faster training and inference times compared to CPU-only solutions.

Training, Testing, and Evaluation Datasets:
Training Dataset:
Training Data Collection: Undisclosed
Training Labeling: Undisclosed
Training Properties: The gpt-oss-20b model has approximately 20 billion total parameters, with approximately 4 billion active parameters per inference. The weights for all layers are in BF16, except for the MoE projection weights, which are in MXFP4. The reference implementation, for initial accuracy validation, currently upcasts all weights to BF16. Activations are expected to be in BF16 or FP8.
Testing Dataset:
Testing Data Collection: Undisclosed
Testing Labeling: Undisclosed
Testing Properties: The model's performance is tested against recognized benchmarks such as MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) and GPQA (General Purpose Question Answering), alongside other benchmarks including LiveCodeBench, AIME 2024, and MATH-500

Additional Details
The model is released with the native quantization support. Specifically, MXFP4 is used for the linear projection weights in the MoE layer. It is stored the MoE tensor in two parts:

tensor.blocks stores the actual fp4 values. Every two values are packed in one uint8 value.
tensor.scales stores the block scale. The block scaling is done among the last dimension for all MXFP4 tensors.
All other tensors are stored in BF16. It is recommended to use BF16 as the activation precision for the model.

Ethical Considerations:
NVIDIA believes Trustworthy AI is a shared responsibility and we have established policies and practices to enable development for a wide array of AI applications. When downloaded or used in accordance with our terms of service, developers should work with their internal model team to ensure this model meets requirements for the relevant industry and use case and addresses unforeseen product misuse.
